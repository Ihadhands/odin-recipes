        <p>There is nothing better in this world than a delicious grilled ham and cheese.
        </p>
        
        <p>So without further ado, this is my easy grilled cheese. Something that will satisfy anybody.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>20g Ham off the bone.</li>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>2 slices of your favorite bread.</li>
            <li>Butter.</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Butter the outer sides of your bread, optional you can butter the inside as well.</li>
            <li>Place ham on one of the inner sides of the bread.</li>
            <li>Apply a little salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place a handful of mozzarella on top of the ham, honestly as much as you want.</li>
            <li>Put the other side of the bread on top.</li>
            <li>Place a nonstick fry pan onto the stove on medium heat (or if you are like me and are lazy use a sandwich press).</li>
            <li>Place the sandwich carefully onto the fry pan and let it sizzle.</li>
            <li>Flip when the bottom side is nice and golden and continue to cook until the top side is golden brown and cheese has melted.</li>
            <li>Remove from the pan, cut into halves and enjoy immediately (hot tip, try to avoid burning the roof of your mouth).</li>
        </ol>
