        <p>Theres been a lot of times in my life where I can't really think of what to have for dinner.
            So to combat this issue, I always fall back onto this simple recipe. 
        </p>

        <p>*note* These ingredients are quite flexible, feel free to add more toppings if you desire.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pizza base (can be store bought or homemade)</li>
            <li>Pizza sauce (again store bought or homemade)</li>
            <li>Prosciutto</li>
            <li>2 Mushrooms</li>
            <li>Handful of olives</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>First preheat oven to 200 degrees or 180 fan force.</li>
                <li>Put a few dollops of pizza sauce on the pizza base and spread with a spoon,
                    until you have an even coverage of the base</li>
                <li>Dice mushrooms and olives, I like to cut the mushrooms into matchstick shapes.</li>
                <li>Tear prosciutto with hands and place evenly around pizza base.</li>
                <li>Spread mushrooms and olives around pizza base.</li>
                <li>Take small spoonfuls of ricotta cheese and evenly distribute around pizza base.</li>
                <li>Cover pizza in mozzarella cheese, get a nice even coverage but not too thick.</li>
                <li>Finally add a few leaves of rocket or your preferred leafy green on top.</li>
                <li>Place in middle of the oven under a baking sheet. Cook for 10-15 mins or until
                    cheese is golden brown and base is cooked through.</li>
                <li>Remove from oven, cut into quarters and enjoy</li>
            </ol>
